## 4) Recording Setup Checklist
Before recording:
1. Use a demo company with real-looking but non-sensitive sample data.
2. Prepare at least 10 employees so SDL/PAYE examples look realistic.
3. Keep browser zoom at 100% and use one clean screen resolution.
4. Close unrelated tabs and disable noisy notifications.
5. Keep a simple script visible so narration stays focused.

## 5) Master Demo Script (8-10 Minutes)
Use this for your main “How it works” video.

### Scene A: Dashboard (45-60 sec)
On screen:
1. Open `/dashboard`
2. Show cards and Operational Health section

3. "What if data is wrong" -> "Rejected rows and validation messages show exactly what to fix."
4. "Compliance risk is high" -> "Filing workflows, reminders, and audit history reduce missed-deadline risk."

## 9) Demo Data Standards (Important)
1. Never record with real employee personal data.
2. Use Tanzania-relevant names, amounts, dates, and company context.
3. Keep salary and tax examples simple and explainable.
4. Use the same sample company across the series for continuity.

## 10) Video Quality Rules
1. Speak clearly and slower than normal conversation.
2. Keep each section focused on one outcome.
3. Show click path explicitly before explaining details.
4. End every video with one business benefit sentence.
